# Справка по CLI

CLI Mina (интерфейс командной строки) – это основной способ взаимодействия пользователей с сетью Mina, предоставляющий стандартные клиентские функции для создания аккаунтов, отправки транзакций и участия в консенсусе. Существуют также расширенные клиентские команды и daemon для опытных пользователей.

CLI устанавливается при <DocLink copy="установке mina" url="/getting-started#installation" />.

<Alert kind="warning">

API Mina еще находятся на стадии разработки, поэтому эти команды, скорее всего, будут изменены. Смотрите `mina help` для проверки самой последней версии.
