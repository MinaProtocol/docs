# mina-generate-keypair

To simplify the process of creating a keypair, we've created a simple command-line utility called `mina-generate-keypair`. The `mina-generate-keypair` tool has easy to use functionality to create your own Keypair to start participating in the Mina network. Please see below to see how to install and use on your local system.

## Installation

We support several different operating systems for the `mina-generate-keypair` tool. Follow the instructions below to install the tool onto your system.


### macOS

Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install minaprotocol/mina/mina-generate-keypair
```

Check that keygen tool installed correctly by running `mina-generate-keypair -version`. The output should read `Commit [DIRTY]a9402473584c36b347d52df4f4000b7286385987 on branch HEAD`.

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

After [adding the Mina repo](/docs/getting-started#ubuntu-1804--debian-9) you can simply run the following command.

```
sudo apt-get install mina-generate-keypair=0.2.9-a940247
```

Check that keygen tool installed correctly by running `mina-generate-keypair -version`. The output should read `Commit [DIRTY]a9402473584c36b347d52df4f4000b7286385987 on branch HEAD`.

### Windows / Other Platforms

Install Docker and follow the Docker-based instructions in step 3b. below.

## Usage

Creating a keypair is simple and is accomplished in a few short steps.

1. First make sure you have a folder on your system where you can store the key files. We recommend using the `~/keys` folder.

```
mkdir ~/keys
```

2. Next, ensure the permissions are set properly this folder, this prevents unwanted processes from accessing these files.

```
chmod 700 ~/keys
```
3. Generate a key using either the instructions in Step 3a on Debian/Ubuntu, or Step 3b in Docker

<Alert kind="warning">

Make sure to set a new and secure password for the following commands. Mina will never ask you for this password, and you should not share it with anyone.

</Alert>

<br />


3a. In Ubuntu/Debian: Generate your keys using the `mina-generate-keypair` command. When prompted, type in the password you intend to use to secure this key. If is set, the tool will use the password from the CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS environment variable instead of prompting you. <em>Do NOT forget this password.</em>

```
mina-generate-keypair -privkey-path ~/keys/my-wallet
```

3b. In Docker on Windows/MacOS/Linux: Generate your keys using the `minaprotocol/generate-keypair` docker image. When prompted, type in the password you intend to use to secure this key. <em>Do NOT forget this password.</em>

```
cd ~
docker run  --interactive --tty --rm --volume $(pwd)/keys:/keys minaprotocol/generate-keypair:0.2.9-a940247 -privkey-path /keys/my-wallet
```

This will create two files on your system, `~/keys/my-wallet` which contains the encrypted private key and `~/keys/my-wallet.pub` which contains the public key in plain text. Please store the private key file and password you used in a secure place, such as a password manager.

<br />

<Alert kind="warning">

Never give out your private key and make sure they are stored safely. If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and will lose your account funds. Always give out your public keys instead. Mina will never ask you for your private keys.

</Alert>

<br />

4. Finally, ensure the permissions are set properly for the private key file, this prevents unwanted processes from accessing it.

```
chmod 600 ~/keys/my-wallet
```
