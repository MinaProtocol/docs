# Getting Started

Welcome to Mina! This section will walk you through the process of setting up a Mina node. After we will show you how to generate a keypair for use with the network. Finally we'll show you how to connect to the network and begin producing blocks.

<Alert>

This documentation is for the **Mainnet** release.

Network status: <StatusBadge service="Network" />

</Alert>

## Requirements

**Software**: macOS, Linux (currently supportsÂ Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS), or any host with Docker

Note: Windows is not officially supported at this time. However, community members succeeded in setting up nodes using Windows Subsystem for Linux. Click [here](https://minawiki.com/index.php?title=Mina_on_Windows) for instructions on using Windows, which are created by the community. Additionally Windows users can use the Docker documentation.

**Hardware**: Sending and receiving mina does not require any special hardware, but running a block producer on the Mina network currently requires:

- at least a 8-core processor
- at least 16GB of RAM

Note that if you plan on running a snark worker node at the same time as a block producer, you may need more RAM. GPUs aren't currently required, but may be required for node operators when the protoctol is upgraded.

**Network**: At least 1 Mbps connection

**VM Instances**:
O(1) Labs has tested running nodes on several cloud providers, and recommends the following instances for basic node operator needs. Keep in mind that custom requirements as well as different cost constraints may require a different instance type.

- AWS - [c5.2xlarge](https://www.ec2instances.info/?filter=c5.2xl&region=us-west-2&cost_duration=daily&selected=c5.2xlarge)
- GCP - [c2-standard-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types)
- Azure - [Standard_F8s_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-compute#fsv2-series-1)
- Digital Ocean - [c-8-16gib](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?size=c-8-16gib)

Check out our [guide](https://youtu.be/M9lE2lgyVEo) for how to configure your Mina node on Google Cloud.

## Installation

The newest binary releases can be found below. Instructions are provided for macOS and Linux below:

This is a large download, around 1GB, so the install might take some time.

<Alert kind="warning">

If you installed `mina` from a previous release, you'll need to upgrade it so that you won't get banned by the network for using an older client. See instructions below for upgrading both macOS and Linux builds.

</Alert>

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

Add the Mina Debian repo and install:

```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net release main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-mainnet=1.1.8-b10c0e3
```

Check that daemon installed correctly by running `mina version`. The output should read `Commit b10c0e3db9112a2a8aebc3eec7c6d2570fcc4044 on branch master`.

### Windows

Windows is not yet natively supported. If you are interested in receiving a grant to develop Mina for Windows, please email grants@o1labs.org or reach out in the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/MinaDiscord).

Please instead use the Docker instructions below.

### macOS

macOS is used by developers, but we are not officially supporting any pre-built packages at this time.

Please instead use the Docker instructions below or you may build from source.

### Docker

Docker is cross-platform tool that allows you to run a virtual machine that will execute any needed software. Please follow the official installation instructions for your platform on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once docker is installed, proceed to the Mina Docker instructions on <DocLink copy="Connect to the Network" url="/using-mina/connecting" />

### Build from source

If you're running another Linux distro or some version of macOS, you can [try building Mina from source code](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/README-dev.md#building-mina). Please note that other operating systems haven't been tested thoroughly, and may have issues. Feel free to share any logs and get troubleshooting help in the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/MinaDiscord).

## Set up port forwarding and any firewalls

If you are running a firewall, you should allow traffic on TCP port 8302. Additionally, unless the `-external-ip YOUR_IP` flag is provided, the daemon will use HTTPS (443) and HTTP (80) to try and determine its own IP address.

You may need to configure your router's port forwarding to allow inbound traffic to the following ports through your **external** IP address.

- `TCP` port `8302`
- _Optionally_ to use the GraphQL service, expose `TCP` port `3085`

For walk-through instructions see <DocLink copy="this guide" url="/troubleshooting#port-forwarding" />.

## Next

Now that you've installed Mina and configured your network, let's move on to the next step - <DocLink copy="generating a keypair!" url="/using-mina/keypair" />
