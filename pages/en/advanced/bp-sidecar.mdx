# Block Producer Sidecar

In order to maintain eligibility for various grants and the Foundation Delegation Program, you must run a sidecar with your daemon to report node uptime.

If you are required to keep your node online for a grant or specific program, you must run a small sidecar program that will report your daemon's uptime. This tutorial will walk you through the process of installing, configuring and running the sidecar program.

## Installation

The sidecar is a seperate package that can be installed on Debian/Ubuntu or run along side a Docker solution.

### Debian / Ubuntu

Install the sidecar package using the apt package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install -y mina-bp-stats-sidecar=1.1.5-a42bdee
```

This will install the following files:

1. `/usr/local/bin/mina-bp-stats-sidecar` (the mina sidecar program)
2. `/etc/mina-sidecar.json` (the config file for the mina sidecar)
3. `/etc/systemd/system/mina-bp-stats-sidecar.service` (the systemd config to run it as a service)

We will need to update the config file with the correct parameters. So use your prefered editor to replace the contents of `/etc/mina-sidecar.json` with the following:

```
{
  "uploadURL": "https://us-central1-mina-mainnet-303900.cloudfunctions.net/block-producer-stats-ingest/?token=72941420a9595e1f4006e2f3565881b5",
  "nodeURL": "http://127.0.0.1:3095"
}
```

### Docker

If you are using docker, you can simply pull the latest image which we will run in the next section.

```
docker pull minaprotocol/mina-bp-stats-sidecar:latest
```

Next we will need to setup the config file, for this tutorial we will assume you are on a Linux based host system.

We will need to create a config file with the correct parameters. So use your prefered editor to replace the contents of `~/mina-sidecar-config.json` with the following:

```
{
  "uploadURL": "https://us-central1-mina-mainnet-303900.cloudfunctions.net/block-producer-stats-ingest/?token=72941420a9595e1f4006e2f3565881b5",
  "nodeURL": "http://mina:3095"
}
```

We will pass this file into the Docker container in the next step.

## Usage

This sidecar will need to communicate with a running daemon, so you will first need to start your daemon. You will need to run the daemon with the flag `--limited-graphql-port 3095` in order for the sidecar to be able to communicate with the daemon. Further instructions can be found on the [connecting page](/docs/using-mina/connecting).

### Debian / Ubuntu

First ensure the daemon is running on the same machine with the flag `--limited-graphql-port 3095`.

To (optionally) enable the sidecar service to run on reboot you can use:

```
sudo systemctl enable mina-bp-stats-sidecar
```

Then to manually start the sidecar service, use this command:

```
sudo service mina-bp-stats-sidecar start
```

From there you can check that it's running and see the most recent logs with `service mina-bp-stats-sidecar status`

If you want to get logs from the sidecar service, you can use `journalctl`:

```
journalctl -f -u mina-bp-stats-sidecar.service
```

### Docker

First you will need to create a network for the daemon and sidecar containers:

```
docker network create mina-network
```

Next you will need to start the daemon with `--network mina-network` passed to docker, and some new flags `--open-limited-graphql-port --limited-graphql-port 3095` passed to the daemon.

For example:

```
docker run --name mina -d \
--network mina-network \
-p 8302:8302 \
--restart=always \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/keys,dst=/keys,readonly" \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config" \
-e CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS="YOUR PASSWORD HERE" \
minaprotocol/mina-daemon-baked:1.1.5-a42bdee \
daemon \
--open-limited-graphql-port --limited-graphql-port 3095 \
--block-producer-key /keys/my-wallet \
--insecure-rest-server \
--file-log-level Debug \
--log-level Info \
--peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt
```

To start the sidecar container, simply use the following command:

```
docker run \
--name mina-sidecar \
--network mina-network \
--restart=always -d \
-v $(pwd)/mina-sidecar-config.json:/etc/mina-sidecar.json \
minaprotocol/mina-bp-stats-sidecar:latest
```

You can check the logs using the `docker logs` command:

```
docker logs -f mina-sidecar
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get a 400 while running your sidecar:

```
INFO:root:Fetching block 2136...
INFO:root:Got block data
ERROR:root:HTTP Error 400: Bad Request

-- TRACEBACK --

ERROR:root:Sleeping for 30s and trying again
```

It likely means you're shipping off data to the ingest pipeline without any block producer key configured on your Mina node - since your BP key is your identity we can't accept node data since we don't know who is submitting it!
