# Connect to Devnet

In this section, we'll connect to the `Devnet` network. `Devnet` is a network dedicated for developers building on top of the Mina protocol. It is designed for testing
and experimentation of developers and holds no real value. Users can reach out on Discord if they would like to request a prefunded account.

Only use the `Devnet` network if you are a developer and building on top of the Mina protocol. If you are interested in running a node, please connect
to <DocLink copy="Mainnet RC" url="/using-mina/connecting" /> instead.

## Update your software

Connecting to `Devnet` requires a specific build of the Mina client as well as a specific version of a peers list. Using the `Devnet` build and peers list does not work for `Zenith`.

Follow the instructions below for your operating system below.

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

Follow along below to install the latest **Stable** [Mina Release 1.2.2](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases/tag/1.2.2) or visit the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) to discover and install pre-release (Alpha/Beta) builds.

You can set up the new debian `stretch stable` repository and install the latest version as follows:

```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net stretch stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-devnet=1.2.2-feee67c
```

Check that daemon installed correctly by running `mina version`. The output should read `Commit feee67cc2836bf12e792510a2440f28a0275740e on branch master`.

## Start up a node

<Alert kind="status">

You can find the current status of the network and related services here: [status.minaprotocol.com](https://status.minaprotocol.com)

Testnet Status: <StatusBadge service="Network" />

</Alert>

Run the following commands to start up a Mina node instance and connect to the `Devnet` network:

```
mina daemon --peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

### Docker

When running your daemon using Docker, first create a directory on the host machine to mount as a volume:

```
cd ~
mkdir ~/.mina-config
```

Now simply run the image with your ~/.mina-config mounted:

```
docker run --name mina -d \
-p 8302:8302 \
--restart=always \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config" \
minaprotocol/mina-daemon:1.2.2-feee67c-devnet \
daemon \
--peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

Run `docker logs -f mina` to follow the logs, and if it crashes save the log output to a file with `docker logs mina > mina-log.txt`.

Run `docker exec -it mina mina client status` to monitor connectivity to the network.
