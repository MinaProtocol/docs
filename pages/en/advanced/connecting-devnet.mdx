# Connect to Devnet

In this section, we'll connect to the `Devnet` network. `Devnet` is a network dedicated for developers building on top of the Mina protocol. It is designed for testing
and experimentation of developers and holds no real value. Users can reach out on Discord if they would like to request a prefunded account.

Only use the `Devnet` network if you are a developer and building on top of the Mina protocol. If you are interested in running a node, please connect
to <DocLink copy="Mainnet RC" url="/using-mina/connecting" /> instead.

## Update your software

Connecting to `Devnet` requires a specific build of the Mina client as well as a specific version of a peers list. Using the `Devnet` build and peers list does not work for `Zenith`.

Follow the instructions below for your operating system below.

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

First remove any previously installed version of the daemon to prevent any errors when upgrading to the latest version. Then you can install the latest version as follows:

```
sudo apt-get remove -y mina-testnet-postake-medium-curves
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net release main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-testnet-postake-medium-curves=1.0.5-68200c7
```

Check that daemon installed correctly by running `mina version`. The output should read `Commit [DIRTY]68200c7b409e105d174f079c5c39f7926819784b on branch HEAD`.

## Start up a node

<Alert kind="status">

You can find the current status of the network and related services here: [status.minaprotocol.com](https://status.minaprotocol.com)

Testnet Status: <StatusBadge service="Network" />

</Alert>

Run the following commands to start up a Mina node instance and connect to the `Devnet` network:

```
mina daemon -generate-genesis-proof true --peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

### Docker

When running your daemon using Docker, first ensure that your private key has the correct permissions.

```
cd ~
chmod 700 ~/keys
chmod 600 ~/keys/my-wallet
mkdir ~/.mina-config
```

Now simply run the image with your keys and ~/.mina-config mounted:

```
docker run --name mina -d \
-p 8302:8302 \
--restart=always \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/keys,dst=/keys,readonly" \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config" \
-e CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS="YOUR PASSWORD HERE" \
minaprotocol/mina-daemon-baked:1.0.5-68200c7 \
daemon \
--block-producer-key /keys/my-wallet \
--insecure-rest-server \
--file-log-level Debug \
--log-level Info \
--peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

Run `docker logs -f mina` to follow the logs, and if it crashes save the log output to a file with `docker logs mina > mina-log.txt`.

Run `docker exec -it mina mina client status` to monitor connectivity to the network.
