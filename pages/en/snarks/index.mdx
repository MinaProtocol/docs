### What are snapps? 

<br />

<Alert kind="info">

Never give out your private key and make sure they are stored safely. If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and will lose your account funds. Always give out your public keys instead. Mina will never ask you for your private keys.

</Alert>

<br />

Snapps (“snark apps”) are Mina’s **zk-SNARK**-powered smart contracts. 

Snapps use an off-chain execution and mostly off-chain state model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public. 

Using zk-SNARKs, snapps can perform arbitrarily complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain, as opposed to other blockchains which use a gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

Snapps are written in TypeScript 

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type safety, making it easy to get started writing Snapps.

You can learn more on the How to [Write a Snapp]() page.

### Examples of snapps

Play around with a few example snapps to see what’s possible:
