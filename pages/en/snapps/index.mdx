### What are snapps? 

<br />

<Alert kind="info">

Snapps are available only on Snapps Testnet currently.

<br />

Snapps (“snark apps”) are Mina’s **zk-SNARK**-powered smart contracts.

Snapps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

Using zk-SNARKs, snapps can perform arbitrarily complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain, as opposed to other blockchains which use a gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

Snapps are written in TypeScript.

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type safety, making it easy to get started writing Snapps.

You can learn more on the How to write a snapp (*coming soon*) page.

### Examples of snapps

Play around with a few example snapps to see what’s possible:
