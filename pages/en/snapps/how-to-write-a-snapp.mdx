# How to write a snapp

A Snapp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. First, we’ll install the Snapp CLI and write a smart contract.

## Write a smart contract
Your smart contract will be written using <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/snapp-cli/">Snapp CLI</a>. 

Snapp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework (Jest), code auto-formatting (Prettier), linting (ES Lint), & more. 

### Install Snapp CLI

#### Dependencies:
- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+ 
- Git 2+ 

<Alert kind="tip">

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version using the package manager for your system: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac), <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource (<a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall">deb</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall">rpm</a>), as recommended by the NodeJS Project.

</Alert>

### Start a Project

Now that you have Snapp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

#### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure, but with additional files in the `/src` directory as the only difference.

1. **Install:** Run `snapp example sudoku`. This creates a new project and includes the example files (i.e. the smart contract) inside the project’s `src/` directory. Type `ls` & hit enter to see the files that were created or open the directory in a code editor such as VS Code.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build the example:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build` directory.
4. **Deploy example on Testnet:** (Coming soon.) 

You can view a list of <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/snapp-cli/tree/main/examples/">all available examples here</a>. 

#### Option B: Start your own project 

1. **Install:** Run `snapp project <myproj>`. Type `ls` and hit enter to see the newly created project structure.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build`. 
4. **Deploy to Testnet:** (Coming soon.)
5. **Deploy to Mainnet:** (Coming soon.)

### Writing your smart contract’s custom logic

The goal of this section is to explain the concepts that you will need to understand to write a zero-knowledge-based smart contract.

If you haven’t yet read the <DocLink copy="how snapps work" url="/snapps/how-snapps-work" /> section, please read it first so that this section makes sense.

##### SnarkyJS

Snapps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Snapp CLI. 

To view the full SnarkyJS reference, please see <DocLink copy="here" url="/snapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Concepts

Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero-knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of it as a uint256 in Solidity. 

<Alert kind="note">

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: 28,948,022,309,329,048,855,892,746,252,171,976,963,363,056,481,941,560,715,954,676,764,349,967,630,336  

</Alert>

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

 `const sum = 1 + 3`.

In SnarkyJS, you would write this as: 

`const sum = new Field(1).add(new Field(3))`

This can be simplified as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(3)`

Note that the 3 is auto-promoted to a field type to make this cleaner.

##### Primitive data types

A couple common data types you may use are:

```
new Bool();     // accepts true or false
new Field();    // accepts an integer, or a numeric string if you want to represent a number greater than JavaScript can represent but within the max value that a field can store.
```

<Alert kind="info">

Support for strings within SnarkyJS will be available soon.
</Alert>

##### Conditionals

Traditional conditional statements are not yet supported by SnarkyJS:

```ts
// this will NOT work
if (foo) {
  x.assertEquals(y);
}
```

Instead, use SnarkyJS’ built-in `Circuit.if()` method.

const x = Circuit.if(new Bool(foo)).then(a).else(b);

##### Functions

Functions work as you would expect in TypeScript. For example:

```ts
function addOneAndDouble(x: Field): Field {
  return x.add(1).mul(2);
}
```

##### Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3);            // x = 7
x = x.sub(1);            // x = 6
x = x.mul(3);            // x = 18
x = x.div(2);             // x = 9
x = x.square();        // x = 81
x = x.sqrt();             // x = 9
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/snapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Smart Contract

Let’s put this all together and create a basic smart contract. The smart contract is where you define your custom logic. 

For example: *(Gregor will update this section)*

When writing a smart contract, you describe both your custom logic (to be used by the prover) and your assertions (to be used by the verifier) that will prove a given zero-knowledge proof is valid.

In the above example, the computation is `x.mul(x).mul(x)`, the assertion is x3.assertEquals(result), and `expected` is a public input. We’ll discuss these more in a bit.

Notice that our class extends `SmartContract`.  However, your class can contain various other helper methods if desired.

When you build your smart contract (`npm run build`), a file called `smart_contract.js` will be created, which will contain both the **prover function** and the **verifier function** for your circuit.

##### Private Inputs & Public Inputs

**Private inputs** and **public inputs** are data required by either the prover function or verifier function.

**Private inputs** must be provided to the **prover function** when it runs in a user’s web browser. Because this data is provided by the user and remains local on their computer, this remains fully private. It will never exist on chain.

**Public inputs** must be provided to both the **prover function** and the **verifier function** (i.e. the Mina network) when it is verifying a zero-knowledge proof. 

By default, all inputs are private unless you add `@pub` before the parameter.

In the earlier example, the `expected` parameter is public because we marked it with `@pub`, whereas the first input `x` is private by default. Thus, if a user provides a result of `27` with their proof, they prove that they know the cube root of `3`.

##### Prover function 

When the prover function runs, it executes your custom logic to generate a zero-knowledge proof. In the earlier example, `const x3 = x.mul(x).mul(x);` is our custom logic.

##### Assertions

When the verifier function runs on the Mina network, it will execute your smart contract’s assertions to determine if a proof is valid.

Common assertions you may use are:

```ts
x.assertEquals();
x.assertBoolean(); 
x.assertLt();          // less than
x.assertLte();        // less than or equal to
x.assertGt();         // greater than
x.assertGte();       // greater than or equal to
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/snapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

### Managing State

##### Updating on-chain state

The 8 fields of 32 bytes of arbitrary on-chain state can be accessed via `this.state[n]`, where n is 0-7. 

To update the on-chain state of your smart contract, you must use the `.set` method that is defined for every state property. Here, we define a `update` method marked with the `@method` decorator to indicate that this method is callable on the instance of our smart contract. Inside the `update` method, the `num` state property is read into `currentState` by using the `.get` method. To update the `num` state property, the `.set` method is called with its input parameter specifying an add operation with a Field value of 2. Using the `.set` method is how the on-chain state is updated for the Add smart contract.

##### Updating off-chain state

<Alert kind="info">

Off-chain state is not yet available.

### Testing your smart contract

Testing is critical when writing smart contracts.

The <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest testing framework</a> is included in all projects created by the Snapp CLI via `snapp project <name>`. We recommend Jest, but any testing framework can be used.

To run all test files within your project, run `npm run test` or `npm run testw` (for watch mode) from your project’s root directory.

To generate a test coverage report for your project, run `npm run coverage`. Coverage reports show the % of your code that is tested. The result will be output in your terminal. This can be helpful to ensure your code is well tested.


##### Learn more

Please see the <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started">Jest docs</a> for further information on how to use Jest. 

We will be adding blockchain-specific testing functionality in the future. Keep an eye on this section for updates. 

## Writing a UI for your smart contract

To allow users to interact with your smart contract, you’ll typically want to build a website UI. 

This UI can be written with any framework (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) or plain HTML and JavaScript.
