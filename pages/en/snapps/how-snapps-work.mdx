# How snapps work

<Alert kind="info">

Snapps run in the latest versions of <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge">Edge</a>, and <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> currently. We intend to add support for Safari in the future.

Snapps are written in TypeScript using the Snapp CLI. In the upcoming section, How to write a snapp (*coming soon*), we’ll go into detail about writing your first snapp. For now, we’ll discuss how snapps work.

A “snapp” consists of two parts: 1.) a smart contract and 2.) an UI (user interface) for users to interact with it.

<Alert kind="note">

We use the term <b>“smart contract”</b> to refer to the code written with SnarkyJS (which will be introduced below).

We use the term <b>“snapp”</b> to refer to the UI + the smart contract.

### Zero-knowledge based smart contracts

Because Snapps are based on **zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs)**, a snapp developer writes what is called a **“circuit”**, which is the method from which a **prover function** and a corresponding **verifier function** are derived during the build process.

The **prover function** is the function which executes a smart contract’s custom logic. 

The **prover function** runs in a user’s web browser as part of the snapp. When interacting with a Snapp UI, users will enter any data (e.g. “buy ABC for y price”) required as input to the prover function, which will then generate a zero-knowledge proof.

<img src="/static/img/docs-images/4_Snapps_Prover_Function.jpg" width="90%" />

Both **private inputs** and **public inputs** represent data that must be provided to the prover function when it runs in the user’s web browser.

**Private inputs** are not needed again after that point. But **public inputs** must be also provided to the verifier function (to be introduced soon) when it runs on the Mina network, and as such should never be used for data that you want to remain private.

The **verifier function** is the function that validates whether a zero-knowledge proof successfully passes all the constraints defined in the prover function. This *always* runs quickly and efficiently *irrespective of the prover function’s complexity*.

Within the Mina network, Mina acts as the verifier and runs the verifier function. We’ll describe how this works soon.

### Mina’s Prover Function & Verifier Key

When a snapp developer writes their smart contract and runs `npm run build`, the build process outputs `smart_contract.js`. From this, you can run your prover function or generate a verification key, which you will need to run or deploy your smart contract, respectively.

The **prover function** runs in a user’s web browser. 

The **verification key** lives on chain for a given snapp account and is used by the Mina network to verify that a zero-knowledge proof has met all constraints defined in the prover. A verification key is required in order to create a snapp account. We will describe this more below.

The next two sections will go into more detail about how the prover and verifier functions are used when a Snapp is deployed and when users interact with a Snapp.

### Deploying a smart contract

<img src="/static/img/docs-images/6_Snapps_DeploySmartContract.jpg" width="75%" />

To deploy a smart contract, means to put it on Mina network.  To do this, the developer uses Snapp CLI. The deployment process sends a transaction containing the verification key to an address on the Mina blockchain. 

When a Mina address contains a verification key, it acts as a **snapp account**. 
Whereas a regular Mina account can receive any transactions, a snapp account can only successfully receive transactions containing a proof that satisfies the verifier function. Any transactions that do not pass the verifier function will be rejected by the Mina network.

<Alert kind="info">

When you deploy to a new Mina address, the Mina Protocol will charge a 1 MINA fee for account creation. This is unrelated to snapps and is to help prevent sybil or denial of service attacks.

### Deploying a Snapp UI

<img src="/static/img/docs-images/7_Snapps_DeploySnappUI.jpg" width="95%" />
<br></br>

Developers usually build a UI to allow users to interact with the smart contract.

Typically, this is a static website deployed to a host of the developer’s choosing. We recommend web hosts that offer a global CDN to ensure the best user experience.

Your website needs to contain the `smart_contract.js` file that was generated when building your smart contract. On the How to write a snapp (*coming soon*) page, we will go into more detail.

### How users interact with the Snapp


<Alert kind="info">

To use a snapp, users must <a href="https://www.aurowallet.com/">install Auro wallet for Google Chrome</a>. We anticipate other wallets to add support for snapps in the future.

</Alert>

<br />

Auro is the only wallet that supports snapp transactions currently. However, we plan to expand support for snapps to other types of wallets (such as mobile wallets and desktop wallets) in the future.

After a snapp is deployed to a host (e.g.  mycoolsnapp.com), users can interact with it:

1. User visits mycoolsnapp.com.
2. User interacts with the snapp and enters any data as required. (For example, if this were an automated market maker, the user might specify to “buy x amount of ABC at y price”.)
3. The prover function in the snapp will now generate a zero-knowledge proof locally given the data entered by the user. This data can be either private (which will never be seen by the blockchain) or public (which will be stored either on chain or off chain), depending on what the developer specified, as needed for a given use case. Additionally, a list of state updates to be created by this transaction is generated and is associated with this proof. (We refer to these as “events” and we’ll describe them in more detail further below.) 
4. User clicks “submit to chain” in the snapp UI and their wallet (such as a browser extension wallet) will prompt them to confirm sending the transaction. The wallet signs the transaction containing the proof and associated description of state to update and sends it to the Mina blockchain. 
5. When the Mina network receives this transaction, it will verify that the proof successfully passes the verifier method listed on the snapp account. If the network accepts this transaction, this indicates that this proof and the requested state changes are valid and, as such, are allowed to update the snapp’s state.  
	
Because the user’s interaction occurs *locally* within their web browser (using JavaScript on the client), the user’s privacy can be maintained.

### How is state updated on chain

You may be wondering how the state on a snapp account gets updated on chain. We glossed over that detail earlier to keep things simple.

When the prover function runs in a web browser, the smart contract outputs a proof and some associated data that we call “events”. This is sent as part of the transaction when sending a transaction to a snapp address. These events are a plaintext description (in JSON) describing how to update the state on a snapp account. 

The integrity of these events is ensured by passing a hash of these events as a public input to the smart contract. They must be present and unmodified for the verification function to pass successfully when it runs on Mina. In this way, the Mina network can confirm the integrity of both the proof and the associated events which describe how to update the snapp account’s state.
