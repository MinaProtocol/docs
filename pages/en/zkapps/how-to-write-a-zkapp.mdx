# How to write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. First, we’ll install the Mina zkApp CLI and write a smart contract.

## Write a smart contract

Your smart contract will be written using <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/">Mina zkApp CLI</a>.

Mina zkApp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework (<a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>), code auto-formatting (<a href="https://prettier.io/
">Prettier</a>), linting (<a href="https://eslint.org/">ES Lint</a>), & more.

### Install Mina zkApp CLI

#### Dependencies:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

<Alert kind="tip">

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version using the package manager for your system: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac), <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource (<a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall">deb</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall">rpm</a>), as recommended by the NodeJS Project.

</Alert>

### Start a project

Now that you have Mina zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

#### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure, but with additional files in the `/src` directory as the only difference.

1. **Install:** Run `zk example sudoku`. This creates a new project and includes the example files (i.e. the smart contract) inside the project’s `src/` directory. Type `ls` & hit enter to see the files that were created or open the directory in a code editor such as VS Code.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build the example:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build` directory.
4. **Deploy example on Testnet:** (Coming soon.)

You can view a list of <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/tree/main/examples/">all available examples here</a>.

#### Option B: Start your own project

1. **Install:** Run `zk project <myproj>`. Type `ls` and hit enter to see the newly created project structure.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build`.
4. **Deploy to Testnet:** (Coming soon.)
5. **Deploy to Mainnet:** (Coming soon.)

### Writing your smart contract’s custom logic

The goal of this section is to explain the concepts that you will need to understand to write a zero-knowledge-based smart contract.

If you haven’t yet read the <DocLink copy="how zkApps work" url="/zkapps/how-zkapps-work" /> section, please read it first so that this section makes sense.

##### SnarkyJS

zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Mina zkApp CLI.

To view the full SnarkyJS reference, please see <DocLink copy="here" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Concepts

Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero-knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of it as a uint256 in Solidity.

<Alert kind="note">

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: 28,948,022,309,329,048,855,892,746,252,171,976,963,363,056,481,941,560,715,954,676,764,349,967,630,336

</Alert>

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

`const sum = 1 + 3`.

In SnarkyJS, you would write this as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(new Field(3))`

This can be simplified as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(3)`

Note that the 3 is auto-promoted to a field type to make this cleaner.

##### Primitive data types

A couple common data types you may use are:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
new Bool(x);   // accepts true or false
new Field(x);  // accepts an integer, or a numeric string if you want to represent a number greater than JavaScript can represent but within the max value that a field can store.
new UInt64(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 64 bits
new UInt32(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 32 bits
PrivateKey, PublicKey, Signature; // useful for accounts and signing
new Group(x, y); // a point on our elliptic curve, accepts two Fields/numbers/strings
Scalar; // the corresponding scalar field (different than Field)
```

In the case of `Field` and `Bool`, you can also call the constructor without `new`:

```ts
let x = Field(10);
let b = Bool(true);
```

<Alert kind="info">

Support for strings within SnarkyJS will be available soon.

</Alert>

##### Conditionals

Traditional conditional statements are not yet supported by SnarkyJS:

```ts
// this will NOT work
if (foo) {
  x.assertEquals(y);
}
```

Instead, use SnarkyJS’ built-in `Circuit.if()` method, which is a ternary operator:

```ts
const x = Circuit.if(new Bool(foo), a, b); // behaves like `foo ? a : b`
```

##### Functions

Functions work as you would expect in TypeScript. For example:

```ts
function addOneAndDouble(x: Field): Field {
  return x.add(1).mul(2);
}
```

##### Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3); // x = 7
x = x.sub(1); // x = 6
x = x.mul(3); // x = 18
x = x.div(2); // x = 9
x = x.square(); // x = 81
x = x.sqrt(); // x = 9

let b = x.equals(8); // b = Bool(false)
b = x.greaterThan(8); // b = Bool(true)
b = b.not().or(b).and(b); // b = Bool(true)
b.toBoolean(); // true

let hash = Poseidon.hash([x]); // takes array of Fields, returns Field

let privKey = PrivateKey.random(); // create a private key
let pubKey = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(privKey); // derive public key
let msg = [hash];
let sig = Signature.create(privKey, msg); // sign a message
sig.verify(pubKey, msg); // Bool(true)
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

#### Smart Contract

Let’s put this all together and create a basic smart contract. This where you define your custom logic.

Smart contracts are written by extending the base class `SmartContract`:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

A smart contract can contain **on-chain state**, which is declared as a property
on the class with the `@state` decorator:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();
}
```

Here, `x` is of type `Field`. Only types built out of Field can be used for state variables.
In the current design, the state can consist of at most 8 Fields of 32 bytes each.
States are initialized with the `State()` function.

The `constructor` of a `SmartContract` is inherited from the base class and should not be overriden.
It takes the zkApp account address (a public key) as its only argument:

```ts
let zkAppKey = PrivateKey.random();
let zkAppAddress = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(zkAppKey);

let zkApp = new SmartContract(zkAppAddress);
```

##### Deployment

There is one method that every smart contract needs: `deploy`. It describes how the zkApp account
will be initialized when the zkApp is deployed:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  deploy(initialBalance: UInt64, x: Field) {
    super.deploy();
    this.balance.addInPlace(initialBalance);
    this.x.set(x);
  }
}
```

The deploy method needs one default parameter, the initial balance of the zkApp account.
The first two lines below are mandatory:

```ts
super.deploy();
this.balance.addInPlace(initialBalance);
```

You are free to add additional parameters, like the initial values of your state.
State variables can be initialized during deployment using the `.set` method on `State`:

```ts
this.x.set(x);
```

Uninitialized values will be zero.

##### Methods and state updates

To update your zkApp state or to send MINA, your smart contract will need one or more custom methods.

You declare methods using the `@method` decorator:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async increment() {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    this.x.set(x.add(1));
  }
}
```

The `increment()` method in our example is async because it calls `this.x.get()`.
This is how you can fetch the current state of the zkApp account from the chain.

The method then sets the new state to `x + 1` using `this.x.set()`.

The methods `.get()` and `.set()` are defined on every state property.

##### Assertions

Let's modify the `increment()` method to accept a parameter:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async increment(xPlus1: Field) {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    x.add(1).assertEquals(xPlus1);
    this.x.set(xPlus1);
  }
}
```

Here, after obtaining the current state `x`, we make an _assertion_: `x.add(1).assertEquals(xPlus1);`.

If the assertion fails, SnarkyJS will throw an error and not submit the transaction.
On the other hand, if it succeeds, it will become a part of the proof that is sent to the chain and that is verified on-chain.

Because of this, our new version of `increment()` is guaranteed to behave like the previous version: It can only ever
update the state `x` to `x + 1`.

Assertions can be incredibly useful to constrain state updates. Common assertions you may use are:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
x.assertEquals(y); // x = y
x.assertBoolean(); // x = 0 or x = 1
x.assertLt(y);     // x < y
x.assertLte(y);    // x <= y
x.assertGt(y);     // x > y
x.assertGte(y);    // x >= y
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Public and private inputs

While the state of a zkApp is **public**, method parameters are **private**.

When a smart contract method is called, its code will execute on the client and generate a proof,
which is then sent to the network to update the chain.
The proof uses zero-knowledge to hide inputs and details of the computation.

<!-- The proof has _public inputs_ that block producers need to see -- for example, any state updates triggered by our method. -->

The only way method parameters can be exposed is when the computation explicitly exposes them, as
in our last example where the input was directly stored in the public state: `this.x.set(xPlus1);`

Let's show an example where this is not the case, by defining a new method called `incrementSecret()`:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async incrementSecret(secret: Field) {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    Poseidon.hash(secret).assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash(secret.add(1)));
  }
}
```

This time, our input is called `secret`. We check that the hash of our secret is equal to the current state `x`.
If this is the case, we add 1 to the secret and set `x` to the hash of that.

When running this successfully, it just proves that the code was run with _some_ input `secret` whose hash is `x`,
and that the new `x` will be set to `hash(secret + 1)`.
However, the secret itself remains private, because it can't be deduced from it's hash.

### Managing State

##### Updating on-chain state

As we saw before, on-chain state can be managed inside smart contract methods using `.get()` and `.set()`.

<!-- To access on-chain state from outside a `SmartContract`, you can use `Mina.getAccount`:

```ts
import { Mina } from "snarkyjs";

let snappState = (await Mina.getAccount(snappAddress)).snapp.appState;
``` -->

##### Updating off-chain state

<Alert kind="info">

Off-chain state is not yet available.

### Testing your smart contract

Testing is critical when writing smart contracts.

The <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest testing framework</a> is included in all projects created by the Mina zkApp CLI via `zk project <name>`. We recommend Jest, but any testing framework can be used.

To run all test files within your project, run `npm run test` or `npm run testw` (for watch mode) from your project’s root directory.

To generate a test coverage report for your project, run `npm run coverage`. Coverage reports show the % of your code that is tested. The result will be output in your terminal. This can be helpful to ensure your code is well tested.

##### Learn more

Please see the <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started">Jest docs</a> for further information on how to use Jest.

We will be adding blockchain-specific testing functionality in the future. Keep an eye on this section for updates.

## Writing a UI for your smart contract

To allow users to interact with your smart contract, you’ll typically want to build a website UI.

This UI can be written with any framework (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) or plain HTML and JavaScript.

### Integrating your smart contract into your zkApp UI

Documentation coming soon.

</Alert>

### Connecting your zkApp with a user's wallet

<Alert kind="info">

Currently, only Auro Wallet's Chrome extension supports zkApp transactions. We
anticipate other wallets to add support over time, which they can do by using
the <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/auro-web3-provider">`auro-web3-provider`</a>
from NPM within their browser-extension wallet.

</Alert>

1. Install <a
   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auro-walletmina-protocol/cnmamaachppnkjgnildpdmkaakejnhae">Auro
   Wallet for Chrome</a>. Users of your zkApp will need to have this wallet
   installed in order to interact with your zkApp. Once installed, `window.mina`
   will automatically become available in the user's browser environment. Your
   zkApp will then use this object to interact with the wallet.

After installing Auro wallet, you can verify this is available in your
environment by opening Chrome browser's developer console and typing
`window.mina` to see that it is defined.

2. Get accounts - To fetch a user's list of Mina accounts, you can use the
   `getAccounts()` method.

```ts
let accounts;
try {
  // accounts is an array of string Mina addresses
  accounts = await window.mina.requestAccounts();
} catch (err) {
  // If the user has a wallet installed but has not created an account, an
  // exception will be thrown. Consider showing "not connected" in your UI.
  console.log(err.message);
}
```

This can be useful to indicate that the user's wallet is successfully
connected to your zkApp.

<img src="/static/img/docs-images/Mina_Provider_Header.png" width="100%" />

```ts
// Show first 6 and last 4 characters of user's Mina account.
const display = `${accounts[0].slice(0, 6)}...${accounts[0].slice(-4)}`;
```

3. Sending a transaction - After your user interacts with your zkApp, you can
   sign and send the transaction using `sendTransaction()`.

```ts
try {
  const tx = await Mina.transaction(() => {
    new YourSmartContract(zkAppAddress).foo();
  });

  await tx.prove();

  const { hash } = await window.mina.sendTransaction({
    transaction: tx.toJSON(),
    feePayer: {
      fee: 0.1,
      memo: "zk",
    },
  });

  console.log(hash);
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message);
}
```

<Alert kind="info">
If an error occurs when sending the transaction, you may want to show the error
message in your UI to the user.

</Alert>

You will receive a transaction ID as soon as the Mina network has received the
proposed transaction. But keep in mind that this does not guarantee that
the network will accept the transaction into an upcoming block.

<Alert kind="info">
