# How to write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. First, we’ll install the Mina zkApp CLI and write a smart contract.

## Write a smart contract

Your smart contract will be written using <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/">Mina zkApp CLI</a>.

Mina zkApp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework (<a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>), code auto-formatting (<a href="https://prettier.io/
">Prettier</a>), linting (<a href="https://eslint.org/">ES Lint</a>), & more.

### Install Mina zkApp CLI


```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```


#### Dependencies:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

<Alert kind="tip">

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version using the package manager for your system: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac), <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource (<a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall">deb</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall">rpm</a>), as recommended by the NodeJS Project.

</Alert>

### Start a project

Now that you have Mina zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

#### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure, but with additional files in the `/src` directory as the only difference.

1. **Install:** Run `zk example sudoku`. This creates a new project and includes
   the example files (i.e. the smart contract) inside the project’s `src/`
   directory. Type `ls` & hit enter to see the files that were created or open
   the directory in a code editor such as VS Code.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a
   href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should
   see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch
   mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build the example:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript
   into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build` directory.
4. **Deploy to QANet:** Run `zk config`, which will walk you through adding a
   network alias to your project’s `config.json`. For Berkeley QANet, we recommend
   using `berkeley` as the name, `0.1` for the fee, and
   `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql` for the url. Then run `zk deploy` and follow the prompts. See the <DocLink copy="Deployment section"
   url="/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp#deployment" /> for further details.

You can view a list of <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/tree/main/examples/">all available examples here</a>.

#### Option B: Start your own project

1. **Install:** Run `zk project <myproj>`. Type `ls` and hit enter to see the
   newly created project structure.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a
   href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should
   see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch
   mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript code into
   JavaScript inside the project’s `/build`.
4. **Deploy to QANet:** Run `zk config`, which will walk you through adding a
   network alias to your project’s `config.json`. For Berkeley QANet, we
   recommend using `berkeley` as the name, `0.1` for the fee, and
   `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql` for the url. Then run `zk deploy` and follow the prompts. See the <DocLink copy="Deployment section"
   url="/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp#deployment" /> for further details.
5. **Deploy to Mainnet:** (Coming soon.)

### Writing your smart contract’s custom logic

The goal of this section is to explain the concepts that you will need to understand to write a zero-knowledge-based smart contract.

If you haven’t yet read the <DocLink copy="how zkApps work" url="/zkapps/how-zkapps-work" /> section, please read it first so that this section makes sense.

##### SnarkyJS

zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Mina zkApp CLI.

To view the full SnarkyJS reference, please see <DocLink copy="here" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Concepts

Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero-knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of it as a uint256 in Solidity.

<Alert kind="note">

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: 28,948,022,309,329,048,855,892,746,252,171,976,963,363,056,481,941,560,715,954,676,764,349,967,630,336

</Alert>

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

`const sum = 1 + 3`.

In SnarkyJS, you would write this as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(new Field(3))`

This can be simplified as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(3)`

Note that the 3 is auto-promoted to a field type to make this cleaner.

##### Primitive data types

A couple common data types you may use are:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
new Bool(x);   // accepts true or false
new Field(x);  // accepts an integer, or a numeric string if you want to represent a number greater than JavaScript can represent but within the max value that a field can store.
new UInt64(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 64 bits
new UInt32(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 32 bits
PrivateKey, PublicKey, Signature; // useful for accounts and signing
new Group(x, y); // a point on our elliptic curve, accepts two Fields/numbers/strings
Scalar; // the corresponding scalar field (different than Field)
```

In the case of `Field` and `Bool`, you can also call the constructor without `new`:

```ts
let x = Field(10);
let b = Bool(true);
```

<Alert kind="info">

Support for strings within SnarkyJS will be available soon.

</Alert>

##### Conditionals

Traditional conditional statements are not yet supported by SnarkyJS:

```ts
// this will NOT work
if (foo) {
  x.assertEquals(y);
}
```

Instead, use SnarkyJS’ built-in `Circuit.if()` method, which is a ternary operator:

```ts
const x = Circuit.if(new Bool(foo), a, b); // behaves like `foo ? a : b`
```

##### Functions

Functions work as you would expect in TypeScript. For example:

```ts
function addOneAndDouble(x: Field): Field {
  return x.add(1).mul(2);
}
```

##### Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3); // x = 7
x = x.sub(1); // x = 6
x = x.mul(3); // x = 18
x = x.div(2); // x = 9
x = x.square(); // x = 81
x = x.sqrt(); // x = 9

let b = x.equals(8); // b = Bool(false)
b = x.greaterThan(8); // b = Bool(true)
b = b.not().or(b).and(b); // b = Bool(true)
b.toBoolean(); // true

let hash = Poseidon.hash([x]); // takes array of Fields, returns Field

let privKey = PrivateKey.random(); // create a private key
let pubKey = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(privKey); // derive public key
let msg = [hash];
let sig = Signature.create(privKey, msg); // sign a message
sig.verify(pubKey, msg); // Bool(true)
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

#### Smart Contract

Let’s put this all together and create a basic smart contract. This where you define your custom logic.

Smart contracts are written by extending the base class `SmartContract`:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

A smart contract can contain **on-chain state**, which is declared as a property
on the class with the `@state` decorator:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();
}
```

Here, `x` is of type `Field`. Only types built out of Field can be used for state variables.
In the current design, the state can consist of at most 8 Fields of 32 bytes each.
States are initialized with the `State()` function.

The `constructor` of a `SmartContract` is inherited from the base class and should not be overriden.
It takes the zkApp account address (a public key) as its only argument:

```ts
let zkAppKey = PrivateKey.random();
let zkAppAddress = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(zkAppKey);

let zkApp = new SmartContract(zkAppAddress);
```

##### SnarkyJS Deployment Method

There is one method that every smart contract needs: `deploy`. It describes how the zkApp account
will be initialized when the zkApp is deployed:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  deploy(initialBalance: UInt64, x: Field) {
    super.deploy();
    this.balance.addInPlace(initialBalance);
    this.x.set(x);
  }
}
```

The deploy method needs one default parameter, the initial balance of the zkApp account.
The first two lines below are mandatory:

```ts
super.deploy();
this.balance.addInPlace(initialBalance);
```

You are free to add additional parameters, like the initial values of your state.
State variables can be initialized during deployment using the `.set` method on `State`:

```ts
this.x.set(x);
```

Uninitialized values will be zero.

##### Methods and state updates

To update your zkApp state or to send MINA, your smart contract will need one or more custom methods.

You declare methods using the `@method` decorator:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async increment() {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    this.x.set(x.add(1));
  }
}
```

The `increment()` method in our example is async because it calls `this.x.get()`.
This is how you can fetch the current state of the zkApp account from the chain.

The method then sets the new state to `x + 1` using `this.x.set()`.

The methods `.get()` and `.set()` are defined on every state property.

##### Assertions

Let's modify the `increment()` method to accept a parameter:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async increment(xPlus1: Field) {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    x.add(1).assertEquals(xPlus1);
    this.x.set(xPlus1);
  }
}
```

Here, after obtaining the current state `x`, we make an _assertion_: `x.add(1).assertEquals(xPlus1);`.

If the assertion fails, SnarkyJS will throw an error and not submit the transaction.
On the other hand, if it succeeds, it will become a part of the proof that is sent to the chain and that is verified on-chain.

Because of this, our new version of `increment()` is guaranteed to behave like the previous version: It can only ever
update the state `x` to `x + 1`.

Assertions can be incredibly useful to constrain state updates. Common assertions you may use are:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
x.assertEquals(y); // x = y
x.assertBoolean(); // x = 0 or x = 1
x.assertLt(y);     // x < y
x.assertLte(y);    // x <= y
x.assertGt(y);     // x > y
x.assertGte(y);    // x >= y
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Public and private inputs

While the state of a zkApp is **public**, method parameters are **private**.

When a smart contract method is called, its code will execute on the client and generate a proof,
which is then sent to the network to update the chain.
The proof uses zero-knowledge to hide inputs and details of the computation.

<!-- The proof has _public inputs_ that block producers need to see -- for example, any state updates triggered by our method. -->

The only way method parameters can be exposed is when the computation explicitly exposes them, as
in our last example where the input was directly stored in the public state: `this.x.set(xPlus1);`

Let's show an example where this is not the case, by defining a new method called `incrementSecret()`:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method async incrementSecret(secret: Field) {
    const x = await this.x.get();
    Poseidon.hash(secret).assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash(secret.add(1)));
  }
}
```

This time, our input is called `secret`. We check that the hash of our secret is equal to the current state `x`.
If this is the case, we add 1 to the secret and set `x` to the hash of that.

When running this successfully, it just proves that the code was run with _some_ input `secret` whose hash is `x`,
and that the new `x` will be set to `hash(secret + 1)`.
However, the secret itself remains private, because it can't be deduced from it's hash.

### Managing State

##### Updating on-chain state

As we saw before, on-chain state can be managed inside smart contract methods using `.get()` and `.set()`.

<!-- To access on-chain state from outside a `SmartContract`, you can use `Mina.getAccount`:

```ts
import { Mina } from "snarkyjs";

let snappState = (await Mina.getAccount(snappAddress)).snapp.appState;
``` -->

##### Updating off-chain state
