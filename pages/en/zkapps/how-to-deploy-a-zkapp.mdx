# Deployment

## Add a network alias to config.json

Before deploying, we must first define which network that we will deploy to and
give it a name. We do this by creating a network alias within your project's
`config.json`.

First, change into the directory containing your project and then run the
following command:

```sh
$ zk config
```

It will ask you to specify a name (can be anything), URL to deploy to, & fee (in
MINA) used when sending your deploy transaction. The URL is the Mina GraphQL API
that will receive your deploy transaction and broadcast it to the Mina network.
Note that this URL is important because it also determines which network you're
be deploying to (e.g. QANet, Testnet, Mainnet, etc).

For Berkeley QANet, let's use the following values:

- **Network Name**: `berkeley`
- **URL**: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
- **Fee**: `0.1`

<Alert kind="info">
  If your project contains multiple smart contracts (e.g. `Foo` and `Bar`) that
  you intend to deploy to the same network, we recommend following a naming
  pattern such as `berkeley-foo` and `berkeley-bar` for your network alias
  names.
</Alert>

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk config

Add a new network:
✔ Choose a name (can be anything): · berkeley
✔ Set URL to deploy to: · https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql
✔ Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): · 0.1
✔ Create key pair at keys/berkeley.json
✔ Add network to config.json

Success!

Next steps:

- If this is a testnet, request tMINA at:
  https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>
- To deploy, run: `zk deploy berkeley`
```

## Request funds from the faucet

To deploy your zkApp, you will need some funds to pay for transaction fees.

To get funds on the Berkeley network, use the URL that was shown from the CLI output. Visit `https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>` and click **Request**.

You will have to wait a few minutes for the next block to include your transaction, so you'll have tMINA before proceeding to the next step.

## Deploying your smart contract

To deploy your smart contract to the network, run the following command:

```sh
$ zk deploy berkeley
```

When running the deploy command, the zkApp CLI will compute a verification key for your zkApp CLI. Computing the verification key can take 1-2 minutes so please be patient. The zkApp CLI will show you the details of the transaction such as the network name, the URL, and the smart contract that will be deployed..

Finally, enter `yes` or `y` when prompted, to confirm and send the transaction.

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk deploy berkeley
✔ Build project
✔ Generate build.json
✔ Choose smart contract
  Only one smart contract exists in the project: Add
  Your config.json was updated to always use this
  smart contract when deploying to this network.
✔ Generate verification key (takes 1-2 min)
✔ Build transaction
✔ Confirm to send transaction
  Are you sure you want to send (yes/no)? · y
✔ Send to network

Success! Deploy transaction sent.

Next step:
  Your smart contract will be live (or updated)
  as soon as the transaction is included in a block:
  https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com/transaction/<txn-hash>
```

After a few minutes, the transaction will be included in the next block. To see your changes, search for the address that you used on [berkeley.minaexplorer.com](https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com).

# Writing a UI for your smart contract

To allow users to interact with your smart contract, you’ll typically want to build a website UI.

This UI can be written with any framework (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) or plain HTML and JavaScript.

<Alert kind="info">

This is not yet production ready, but is work in progress.

</Alert>

## Adding your smart contract as a dependency of the UI

<Alert kind="info">

You can integrate your smart contract by publishing it to npm and adding it as a  
 dependency of your UI.

</Alert>

#### Publish to npm

The `index.ts` file is the entry point of your project. This file only imports all smart contract classes you want access to, and exports them. This pattern allows you to specify which smart contracts are available to import when consuming your project from npm within your UI.

```ts
import { YourSmartContract } from './YourSmartContract.js';

export { YourSmartContract };
```

1. **Create an npm account:** Create one <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/signup">here</a> if you don't have one yet.
2. **Login:** To sign in, enter `npm login` on the command line. You will be prompted to enter your username, password, and email address.
3. **Publish:** To publish your package, enter `npm publish` on the command line at the root of your smart contract project directory. If the package name already exists on npm, you will get an error. You can change the package name by changing the name property in your `package.json`.

<Alert kind="tip">

You can check if a package name already exists on npm using the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-search">npm search</a>
terminal command. To avoid naming collisions, npm allows to publish scoped packages:
`@your-username/your-package-name`. For additional details about publishing packages including scoped packages, see the full npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/introduction-to-packages-and-modules">reference docs</a>.

</Alert>

#### Consuming your smart contract in your UI

Once you have published your smart contract to npm, you can easily add it to any UI framework of your choosing by importing the package.

1. **Install your smart contract package:** To install your package, run the following npm command: `npm install your-package-name` from the root of your UI project directory. Or if you published a scoped npm package, run `npm install @your-username/your-project-name`.
2. **Import your smart contract package into the UI using:** `import { YourSmartContract } from ‘your-smart-contract’;` , where `YourSmartContract` is the named export that you chose in your smart contract.

<Alert kind="tip">

For a more performant UI, you may want to render your UI before importing and loading your smart contract. This allows the SnarkyJS wasm workers to perform initialization without blocking the UI.

For example, if your UI is built using React, loading the smart contract in a `useEffect`,
instead of a top level import, will give the UI time to render its components before
loading SnarkyJS.

</Alert>

**Loading your contract with React**

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const { YourSmartContract } = await import("your-smart-contract");
  })();
}, []);
```

**Loading your contract with Svelte**

```ts
onMount(async () => {
  const { YourSmartContract } = await import("your-smart-contract");
});
```

**Loading your contract with Vue**

```ts
onMounted(async () => {
  const { YourSmartContract } = await import("your-smart-contract");
});
```

#### Enabling the COOP and COEP headers

To successfully load any SnarkyJS code in your UI, you must set the [COOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)
and [COEP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) headers to set up a cross-origin isolated
environment that enables the use of [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).
SnarkyJS relies on the use of `SharedArrayBuffer` to enable important WebAssembly features.

There are many alternatives available to enable these headers. For example, if you deploy your UI to products like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), you can set these headers in a custom configuration file. Otherwise, you can set these headers in the server framework of your choice (e.g., Express for JavaScript).

<Alert kind="tip">

COOP must be set to `same-origin`.

COEP must be set to `require-corp`.

</Alert>

**Setting COOP and COEP in your Vercel configuration**:

To see more details on deploying to Vercel, [see their documentation on `vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration).

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" },
        { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Setting COOP and COEP in your Cloudflare Pages configuration**:

To see more details on deploying to Cloudflare Pages, [see their documentation on `_headers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/headers/).

```
/*
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```
