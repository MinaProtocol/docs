Berkeley QANet, which is used by the core team for development and testing, is currently down and awaiting redeployment soon. We'll remove this note when it's available for use again.

# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your smart contract.

## Add a deploy alias to config.json

Before deploying, we must first define a few settings, such as which network we are deploying to. We do this by creating a "deploy alias" within your smart contract project's
`config.json`.

First, change into the directory containing your smart contract and then run the
following command:

```sh
zk config
```

It will ask you to specify a name (can be anything), URL to deploy to, & fee (in
MINA) to be used when sending your deploy transaction. The URL is the Mina GraphQL API
that will receive your deploy transaction and broadcast it to the Mina network.
Note that this URL is significant because it also determines which network you're
be deploying to (e.g. QANet, Testnet, Mainnet, etc).

For Berkeley QANet, let's use the following values:

- **Name**: `berkeley`
- **URL**: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
- **Fee**: `0.1`

<Alert kind="tip">
  If your project contains multiple smart contracts (e.g. `Foo` and `Bar`) that
  you intend to deploy to the same network, we recommend following a naming
  pattern such as `berkeley-foo` and `berkeley-bar` when naming your deploy
  aliases. You can change their names at anytime within `config.json`.
</Alert>

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk config

Add a new network:
✔ Choose a name (can be anything): · berkeley
✔ Set URL to deploy to: · https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql
✔ Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): · 0.1
✔ Create key pair at keys/berkeley.json
✔ Add network to config.json

Success!

Next steps:

- If this is a testnet, request tMINA at:
  https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>
- To deploy, run: `zk deploy berkeley`
```

## Request funds from the faucet

To deploy your zkApp, you will need some funds to pay for transaction fees.

To get funds on the Berkeley QANet, use the URL that was shown from the CLI output. Visit `https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>` and click **Request**.

You will have to wait a few minutes for the next block to include your transaction, so you'll have tMINA before proceeding to the next step.

## Deploy your smart contract

To deploy your smart contract to the network, run the following command:

```sh
zk deploy berkeley
```

When running the deploy command, the zkApp CLI will compute a verification key for your zkApp CLI. Computing the verification key can take 1-2 minutes, so please be patient. The zkApp CLI will show you the details of the transaction such as the network name, the URL, and the smart contract that will be deployed..

Finally, enter `yes` or `y` when prompted, to confirm and send the transaction.

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk deploy berkeley
✔ Build project
✔ Generate build.json
✔ Choose smart contract
  Only one smart contract exists in the project: Add
  Your config.json was updated to always use this
  smart contract when deploying to this network.
✔ Generate verification key (takes 1-2 min)
✔ Build transaction
✔ Confirm to send transaction
  Are you sure you want to send (yes/no)? · y
✔ Send to network

Success! Deploy transaction sent.

Next step:
  Your smart contract will be live (or updated)
  as soon as the transaction is included in a block:
  https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com/transaction/<txn-hash>
```

After a few minutes, the transaction will be included in the next block. To see your changes, search for the address that you used on [berkeley.minaexplorer.com](https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com).
