### What are zkApps?

zkApps (“snark apps”) are Mina’s **zk-SNARK**-powered smart contracts.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

Using zk-SNARKs, zkApps can perform arbitrarily complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain, as opposed to other blockchains which use a gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in TypeScript.

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps.

You can learn more on the <DocLink copy="how to write a zkApp" url="/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp" /> page.

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what’s possible:
