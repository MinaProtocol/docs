Please note that zkApp programmability is not yet available on Mina, but zkApps
can now be deployed to Berkeley QANet. These docs are a preview of work that is
currently in progress.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps ("zero-knowledge apps") are Mina Protocol’s smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation, as opposed to other blockchains that run computations on chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps. If you're new to using TypeScript, check out this helpful [12min introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM).

When you're ready to write a zkApp, you can learn more on the <DocLink copy="how to write a zkApp" url="/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp" /> page.

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what’s possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone (
