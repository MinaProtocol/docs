Please note that zkApp programmability is not yet available on Mina, but zkApps
can now be deployed to Berkeley QANet. These docs are a preview of work that is
currently in progress.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps ("zero-knowledge apps") are Mina Protocol’s smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation, as opposed to other blockchains that run computations on chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in TypeScript.

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps.

You can learn more on the <DocLink copy="how to write a zkApp" url="/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp" /> page.

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what’s possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone (
