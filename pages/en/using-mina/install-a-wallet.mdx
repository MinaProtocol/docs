# Install a wallet

Wallets allow you to store, send, & receive MINA.

The Mina community has created a variety of different wallets. You can send and receive MINA using any of these wallets, but currently only Auro Wallet for Chrome supports interactions with zkApps.

### Wallet for Node Operators

The Mina CLI also provides the ability to store, send, & receive MINA. However, this intended only for Mina node operators and we do **not** recommend this as a wallet for typical users.
