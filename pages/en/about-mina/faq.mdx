### How large is the Mina Blockchain?

22KB

### Given Mina is only 22KB, where are past transactions stored?

The Mina node can run with an optional flag to make it an archive node. This mean it will store historic transactions which is useful for anyone running a service such as a block explorer, but this data is not needed in order to verify the current consensus state of the protocol.

### What ZK proof system does Mina use?

Mina Protocol uses a custom proof system called Kimchi, which was developed by <a href="https://o1labs.org/">O(1) Labs</a>, and is the only blockchain offering infinite recursion. 

Check out the <a href="https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/plonk/overview.html">Mina Book</a> to learn more about Kimchi and the cryptography powering Mina Protocol.
