# CLI Reference

The Mina CLI (command-line interface) is the primary way for users to interact with the Mina network. It provides standard client functionality to create accounts, send transactions, and participate in consensus. There are also advanced client and daemon commands for power users.

The CLI is installed when you <DocLink copy="install Mina" url="/node-operators/getting-started#installation" />.

<Alert kind="warning">

Mina APIs are still under construction, so these commands will likely change. See `mina help` for the most up-to-date version.

                              otherwise it will communicate through the daemon
                              over the rest-server
