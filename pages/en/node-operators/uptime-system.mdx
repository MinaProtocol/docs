# Instructions for the SNARK-based Uptime Tracking System
Learn how to set up the uptime tracking system for the Foundation Delegation Program

<Alert kind="info">

**PLEASE READ:** This affects the submission of uptime data and the Performance Score results for receiving a delegation.
<br></br>

The current sidecar tracking system is being phased out to be replaced by the SNARK-work-based uptime tracking system. Until further notice, <u>please continue running the sidecar AND SNARK-based tracking system on the SAME node.</u>

Please follow the latest updates and post questions in the [#delegation-program channel](https://discord.gg/ywDzwmGABT) on Discord.

</Alert>

In order to maintain eligibility for various grants and the Foundation Delegation Program, you must connect to our uptime tracking endpoint to run the SNARK-work-based uptime tracking system with your daemon to report node uptime.

If you are required to keep your node online for a grant or specific program, you must run a small uptime tracking program that will report your daemon's uptime. This tutorial will walk you through the process of installing, configuring and running the uptime tracking system.

<Alert kind="note">

<p>We recommend that you save some of your SNARK work data logs. You can also share the logs with us if you’re interested in helping out with data checks.</p>

### Pre-requisites 

Make sure you updated your node to at least release (1.3.1+): 

## How to set up the uptime system

The SNARK-work-based uptime system is built into the mina daemon. The new uptime tracking system no longer requires importing your keypair and supports a new flag `--uptime-submitter-key`, which takes the path to your private key, just like `--block-producer-key`.

To get started, pass in the following information to the daemon:

- The path to the private key with the flag:
`--uptime-submitter-key </path/to/private/key>`

- The URL of our testing backend server with the flag:
`--uptime-url https://uptime-backend.minaprotocol.com/v1/submit`

- The password for the keypair associated with the given public key has the environment variable `UPTIME_PRIVKEY_PASS=<CHANGE_ME_TO_MY_VERY_SECURE_PASSWORD>`. If you are using a .mina-env file on Debian then this value should be on its own line, not included in `EXTRA_FLAGS=`.

Here’s an example of what your .mina-env file should look like for Debian:

~~~
EXTRA_FLAGS="--block-producer-key /home/mina/my-wallet --uptime-submitter-key /home/mina/my-wallet --uptime-url https://uptime-backend.minaprotocol.com/v1/submit"
UPTIME_PRIVKEY_PASS=<CHANGE_ME_TO_MY_VERY_SECURE_PASSWORD>
MINA_PRIVKEY_PASS=<CHANGE_ME_TO_MY_VERY_SECURE_PASSWORD>
CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS=<CHANGE_ME_TO_MY_VERY_SECURE_PASSWORD>
LOG_LEVEL=Info
FILE_LOG_LEVEL=Debug
~~~
