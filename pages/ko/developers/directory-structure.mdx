# Repository Structure

This document describes the file-structure of [the Mina repository](https://github.com/minaprotocol/mina), and what roles various
files play:

- `dockerfiles/`  
   Contains Docker related scripts - TODO explain this better

- `docs/`  
   Documentation for the code and processes for contributing are here. The documentation website with the walkthrough docs lives in `frontend/website/docs`.

- `frontend/`  
   All code related to Mina frontend UIs and products

  - `wallet/`  
     Source code for the Mina wallet

  - `website/`  
     Code for https://minaprotocol.com

    - `docs/`  
       Documentation and instructions on joining the Mina network that live at https://minaprotocol.com/docs

    - `posts/`  
       Markdown docs for blog posts

    - `src/`  
       Source code for the website

    - `static/`  
       Static files like images, etc.

- `rfcs/`  
   This directory contains all accepted RFCs (or "requests for comments") made according to the [RFC process](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#rfcs).

- `scripts/`

- `src/`  
   All protocol source code, both application and library code, is in this directory.

  - `*.opam`  
     These files are needed for our `dune` build system. There must be one for each
    library in `lib`. When you create a library `lib/foo_lib` with a `dune` file giving
    the library's name as `foo_lib`, you must create a `foo_lib.opam` file.

  - `config/`  
     Build time config - these .mlh files define compile time constants and their values.

  - `app/`  
     Applications live here.

    - `cli/`  
       This is the mina client/daemon. It is what you use to run a staker, a snarker, or a simple client for sending and receiving transactions.

    - `website/`  
       Soon to be deprecated directory for the website - most of the code has migrated over to `frontend/website/`

    - `reformat/`  
       This program runs `ocamlformat` on most of the files in the source tree, with a few exceptions.

    - `logproc/`  
       This utility reads from `stdin` and can filter and pretty print the log messages emitted by the mina daemon.

    - `libp2p_helper/`  
       This program uses go-libp2p to implement the peer-to-peer plumbing that Mina daemons need.

  - `external/`  
     Local copies of external libraries which we've had to make some tweaks to.

  - `lib/`  
     Libraries powering mina.
    The libraries here basically fall into two categories.
    1. General purpose data-types and functionality. This includes `snarky`, `fold_lib`, `vrf_lib`, `sgn`, and others.
    2. Application specific functionality, structured as a library. This includes `syncable_ledger`, `staged_ledger`, `transaction_snark`, and others.
