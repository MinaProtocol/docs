Here you can find documentation on how to use **snarky**, a DSL for using zk-SNARKS, as well as **snarkyjs-crypto** a companion JavaScript library providing a suite of cryptographic primitives suitable for use with **snarky**.


## The structure of a SNAPP

A SNAPP (or snarkified app) has two parts:

1. The definition of your zk-SNARK program. This part will be built using **snarky**
   and specifically the <DocLink copy="snarky-universe" url="/snarks/snarky-universe" /> standard library.
2. The rest of the application, which calls into **snarky** to create and verify proofs.
   There are currently APIs for Node.js and OCaml/ReasonML for interacting with **snarky** programs in this way.

    We'll use two Node.js libraries:

    - <DocLink copy="snarkyjs-crypto" url="/snarks/snarkyjs-crypto" />, which gives us access
      to cryptographic hashes, merkle-trees, and signatures that mirror those in snarky-universe
    - [snarkyjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkyjs) which gives us methods for creating and verifying SNARK proofs.

## An example app

Let's build a simple app for proving we know a pre-image to a hash function.
You can find the completed app [here](https://github.com/o1-labs/sfbw-workshop/tree/master/solutions/ex_preimage).

### Building the SNARK
This first step in building our SNAPP is to define our SNARK. In this case, our SNARK
will prove, given a hash value **h**

> I know a field element **x** such that **hash(x) = h**.

where **hash** is the Poseidon hash function provided in snarky-universe.

The snarky component -- [defined in this file](https://github.com/o1-labs/sfbw-workshop/blob/master/solutions/ex_preimage/ex_preimage.re) -- is as follows:

```reasonml
module Universe = (val Snarky_universe.default());
open! Universe.Impl;
open! Universe;

let input = InputSpec.[(module Hash)];

module Witness = Field;

let main = (preimage: Witness.t, h, ()) =>
  Field.assertEqual(Hash.hash([|preimage|]), h);

runMain(input, (module Witness), main);
```

Let's break down this file bit by bit. The top 3 lines
```reasonml
module Universe = (val Snarky_universe.default());
open! Universe.Impl;
open! Universe;
```
are just a preamble which brings in scope all the functions we need. It uses the "default" SNARK construction backend,
which is the Groth16 SNARK instantiated using the bn128 curve.

The next line
```reasonml
let input = InputSpec.[(module Hash)];
```
declares that the public input to our SNARK will be a hash. The "public input" (or "statement") is the value that our
SNARK is checked against.

The next line
```reasonml
module Witness = Field;
```
states that our top-level "witness" (that is, the thing we're proving we know) will be a single field element,
as described above.

Next, we have the `main` function, which really defines our SNARK
```reasonml
let main = (preimage: Witness.t, h, ()) =>
  Field.assertEqual(Hash.hash([|preimage|]), h);
```

Here we write just what we described above: `main` computes the hash of the witness and asserts that it is
equal to the public input `h`.

The arguments to `main` must be

1. The top level witness value.
2. Any public inputs. Here we just have one, `h`.
3. A dummy `()` argument.

The final line
```reasonml
runMain(input, (module Witness), main);
```
sets up our program to work with the Node.js API.

### Using the SNARK
Now we're ready to use our SNARK. We're going to use the Node.js API.

The API is fairly straightforward. We can create a "snarky" object which has 2 methods:

1. `prove`, which takes a statement and a witness and returns a promise of a proof.
2. `verify`, which takes a statement and a proof and returns a promise of a bool.

Here is how it all comes together:

```javascript
const { bn128 } = require('snarkyjs-crypto');
const Snarky = require('snarkyjs');
const snarky = new Snarky("./ex_preimage.exe");

const preImage = bn128.Field.ofInt(5);
const statement = bn128.Hash.hash([ preImage ]);

snarky.prove({
  statement: [ statement ],
  witness: preImage
}).then((proof) => {
  console.log("Created proof:\n" + proof + "\n");
  return snarky.verify({
    "statement": [ statement ],
    "proof": proof
  });
}, console.log).then((verified) => {
  console.log("Was the proof verified? " + verified);
  if (verified) {
    process.exit(0);
  } else {
    process.exit(1);
  }
}, () => { process.exit(1); });
```
