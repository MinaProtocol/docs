# Ledger Hardware Wallet

You can use your [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet to securely store your Mina private keys.

We are working on support for [Ledger Nano X](https://www.ledger.com/), but it is not yet completed.

The operations supported are

- Keypair generation
- Signing payment transactions
- Signing delegation transactions

The app is not yet available for install through the Ledger Live user interface, but if you have a Nano S, you can sideload it onto your Ledger device by following the instructions below.

<Alert kind="warning">
We are currently wrapping up a security audit which has found no vulnerabilities, otherwise development is nearly completed.

Use at your own risk. Make sure you have a backup of your Ledger's BIP39 secret
mnemonic phrase or use a separate Ledger device for testing this app.

Never reuse the same keypair from a testnet on mainnet!

</Alert>

### 12) Using the command line wallet

When a command references `mina_ledger_wallet` later on in these docs, run the commands as `./mina_ledger_wallet ...` from the same powershell prompt.

## Generating a keypair

Note that on a Ledger device, generating a keypair doesn't actually store anything! The Ledger rederives the key every time it runs. This means you don't need to worry about losing your key when you uninstall/reinstall this application.

To derive a keypair and obtain the associated Mina address, open the Mina app on your Ledger device and then on your terminal use `mina_ledger_wallet` command.

For example, to get the Mina address corresponding to hardware wallet account 42 (BIP44 account `44'/12586'/42'/0/0`) you would issue the following command.

```
$ mina_ledger_wallet get-address 42
```

You will be prompted to confirm

```
Get address for account 42 (path 44'/12586'/42'/0/0)
Continue? (y/N) y
```

Once confirmed, you will see

```
Generating address (please confirm on Ledger device)...
```

on your terminal while the Ledger device will display

```
👁  Get Address    >
```

This tells you what type of operation is being requested.

Follow the arrow indicator by pressing and releasing the right button on your Ledger.

The Ledger will now display the BIP44 path for the address you are requesting.

```
    Path (1/2)
  44'/12586'/42'/0 >
```

Note that the 42' in the path above corresponds to the account number. Check that your path's account number matches whatever account number argument you supplied to your `get-address` command.

Press the right button again until the Ledger displays

```
        ✓
<    Generate     >
```

Now press both left and right buttons simultaneously to select this option and generate the address.

The Ledger will now display

```
Processing...
```

whilst it generates the keypair.

Since Mina uses new elliptic curves that are not yet supported in hardware, this process can take up to 47 seconds.

Once completed the Ledger will display the address for you to carefully check and confirm.

```
  Address (1/4)
B62qnh5DZeX6eYFv >
```

Once approved the `mina_ledger_wallet` command will output the result, which you can use.

```
Received address: B62qnh5DZeX6eYFvtBn4nBTniXbN7R6cgKo6gYqQ7E2bKwLD3PTYZ4b
```

Your address 42 will be different than the one above.

<Alert kind="note">
  When generating addresses you should, if possible, start with account 0 and
  increase the account number sequentially each time you require a new address.
</Alert>

## Validating your private key

In order to validate your private key. make sure you have updated to the latest version of the `mina` damemon. Installation instructions can be found on the <DocLink copy="connecting" url="/using-mina/connecting" /> page.

Now that you've created your key -- you'll want to validate that it works. For this keypair, it suffices to verify that signed transactions coming out of the ledger are parsed correctly and that the signature verifies on Mina.

Run the following command:

```
mina_ledger_wallet test-transaction --network mainnet 42 B62qnzbXmRNo9q32n4SNu2mpB8e7FYYLH8NmaX6oFCBYjjQ8SbD7uzV | mina advanced validate-transaction
```

Replace "B62q... " with your public key and 42 with your BIP44 account number. Warning: Make sure that your account_address is the one that corresponds to the account_number!

You'll need to go to your Ledger, check the transaction details and either "Accept" or "Reject".

If you reject, no test-transaction will be generated and this command will exit with an error.

If you accept, a test-transaction will be generated and you should see the following output:

```
Transaction was valid
All transactions were valid
```

## Offline Mode

An alternate method for sending transactions is to use the offline mode of the ledger tool. This mode allows you to sign a transaction without connecting your ledger device to a running daemon. You can append the flag `--offline` to any commands with the `mina_ledger_wallet` tool but we will provide an example of how to use offline mode to send a transaction.

### Sign an offline transaction

First step is to sign a transaction using the offline mode of the ledger:

1. Generate a signed transaction with the following command:

```
mina_ledger_wallet send-payment --offline
```

In offline mode you must specify the `--nonce` and `--fee` parameters. To sign testnet transactions you must specify the `--network testnet` parameter (the default is `mainnet`).

<Alert kind="note">

If you are not on the mainnet, make sure you include the flag `--network testnet` so the ledger knows to sign the transaction for the testnet. Signed transactions for mainnet can be replayed on mainnet.

</Alert>

2. Copy the output of this command.

The output will be a JSON blob that you will need for the next section. It should look something like this:

```
{
  "signature": "389ac7d4077f3d485c1494782870979faa222cd906b25b2687333a92f41e40b925adb08705eddf2a7098e5ac9938498e8a0ce7c70b25ea392f4846b854086d43",
  "payment": {
    "to": "B62qnzbXmRNo9q32n4SNu2mpB8e7FYYLH8NmaX6oFCBYjjQ8SbD7uzV",
    "from": "B62qnzbXmRNo9q32n4SNu2mpB8e7FYYLH8NmaX6oFCBYjjQ8SbD7uzV",
    "fee": "10000000",
    "token": "1",
    "nonce": "0",
    "memo": null,
    "amount": "1000000000",
    "valid_until": "4294967295"
  },
  "stake_delegation": null,
  "create_token": null,
  "create_token_account": null,
  "mint_tokens": null
}
```

### Submit the transaction

This step currently requires a running daemon that's connected to the network, but you can also submit this transaction to any third-party gateway.

1. Run a daemon on <DocLink copy="Devnet" url="/advanced/connecting-devnet" />.

2. Execute the following `send-rosetta-transactions` command.

```
mina advanced send-rosetta-transactions
```

3. Paste the output from the `mina_ledger_wallet` in the previous section and then press Ctrl-D to submit the transaction.

This will send the signed transaction on the network. You should see the following output if the transaction was successfully sent:

```
Dispatched command with TRANSACTION_ID 4Rs6xMHVyo1J1TTQDCzynYvWPdBr9QRY23fuqvnHFvQiM2B4YD14dtWY2sDccbgx7eh5FYAsPSNrZ2M3AqEPfXoXjNxuWTgiwkL3nwaTaGhSoPA7LcfqiWT6uN9oookDeR6ZSMfd2bs9QSPRit8gPt3FSrDo8i3qM383AEG6g5pEm2i1m1cTTwrUe7y4Z2eB6DdWKhFhoYnx5ndQRtZt3D3o7gojdwwdpRzrWZgT9KcJfbXdZNTfXxr3G1VCVqgqmNJ6iGzn4uTGqpqCmJf6zRn196SWUyZ4DYrphvGF8GhJZYyPTwA2BMTBkF9xWC9zzJP8ZrAeyV1qV8k94dZaiyVt7Fac3r6BcDaMonMcpvnGy8fHF9Q25L2tjzHzwKMePkJztB5r
