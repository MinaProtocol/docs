# Hardware Wallet

Mina now supports the usage of hardware wallets such as Ledger to interact with
the protocol, and sign transactions.

<Alert kind="warning">

Disclaimer: Ledger support is experimental. Don't use it on a Ledger device that is handling or has ever handled private keys associated with any accounts of value.

</Alert>

## Requirements

**Software**: Linux (currently supports Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)

Note: macOS and Windows are not officially supported at this time.

**Hardware**: Currently only [Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) is supported

## Installation

**Disclaimer**: This is still highly experimental -- use cautiously, as these
instructions may change. Once the hardware wallet app is available on
[Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live), the installation steps will be stabilized.

The following debian packages are needed to use hardware wallets on linux:

```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev1 libudev-dev
```

### Make sure your computer is recognising the Ledger device

- Plug in the Ledger device, unlock it with your passcode, and go to the menu. Don't open any app,
- Run `lsusb`, and see if the device is listed -- it will have ID `2c97:0001`
- If the Ledger device is not listed, follow the suggestions
  [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues).

### Install the python app loader

The Ledger python loader exists [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python)
and can be downloaded/installed with the following:

```
sudo apt install -y libudev-dev libusb
pip3 install ledgerblue
```

After installing, when running on Linux, make sure the following rules have been
added to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` (e.g. with `sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/20-hw1.rules`),
changing `<UNIX username>` to your unix username:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0004", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
```

### Build/download the Mina Ledger application

Either download the precompiled app binary from
[here](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/ledger-mina-app/releases/tag/v0.1.0), or follow the instructions
at the end of this document to <DocLink copy="build the app from source" url="/hardware-wallet#building-from-source" />.

To load the precompiled app onto the Ledger device, after downloading `ledger-precompile.zip`
from the link above, navigate to the directory that `ledger-precompile.zip` is in, and run the following:

```
unzip ledger-precompile.zip
cd ledger-precompile
./load.sh
```

To delete the app, you can run

```
./delete.sh
```

# Using the hardware wallet

The mina hardware wallet command line tool is a python package called `mina-ledger-cli`:

```
python3 -mpip install mina-ledger-cli==0.0.5
```

If you have connection issues with your hardware wallet, please take a look at
[the troubleshooting help on the Ledger support page](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues).
Oftentimes, connectivity issues can be resolved by adding udev rules. Enter the
following command to automatically add the rules and reload udev:

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```

## Create a new account

Run the following command which will create a public and private keypair in the hardware wallet:

    mina accounts create-hd HD-index

HD-index is a number that works like a seed that you give to the hardware wallet
to create your public and private keypair. If you use the same HD-index with the
same hardware wallet twice, then public and private keypair that gets generated
is the same. If you need to use the same account on another machine, then you
just need to use this command with the same HD-index and the same hardware wallet.

During account creation, your hardware wallet may ask you to confirm the operation.

The response from this command will look like this:

    Keypair generated
    Public key:  B62qrPN5Y5yq8kGE3FbVKbGTdTAJNdtNtB5sNVpxyRwWGcDEhpMzc8g

Since the public key is quite long and difficult to remember, let's save it as
an environment variable:

    export MINA_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>

Now we can access this everywhere as `$MINA_PUBLIC_KEY` -- see if it saved
properly by trying `echo $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY`.

## Make a payment

You can use the same commands to send payments found in

<DocLink copy="the docs" url="/using-mina/send-payment#make-a-payment" />.

There are 2 differences:

1. You do not need to unlock your account before sending the transaction because
   your account is protected by your hardware wallet already.
2. Your hardware wallet may ask you to confirm the operation while signing the
   transaction.

## Troubleshooting

### What if I lose my hardware wallet?

You can buy another `Ledger Nano S` and initialize it with the same 24-word
seed to gain access to your existing account.

### What if I forget the public key of my account?

If you remember the HD-index which you use to generate your account, then you
can use `mina accounts create-hd HD-index` with the same HD-index to regenerate
the public_key.

## Building from source

Building the Ledger app from source requires installing versions of gcc and clang.
This can be done in two ways: you can install them with `sudo apt install gcc clang`,
or you can download precompiled versions of both clang and gcc and then add them
to your `PATH`.

### Downloading precompiled gcc and clang

Following the instructions at [the Ledger Wiki](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userspace/getting_started.html):

- Install standard gcc (for microcontroller firmware and secure device linking)
  (link from ledger link?), by downloading a precompiled binary from
  [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
- Install a standard clang with ROPI support (for secure processor applications),
  following the instructions [here](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to
  build from source or download a precompiled binary.
- Once you have downloaded the binaries, unzip and install them, for example with
  ```
  cd Downloads
  tar -xf clang+llvm-7.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz
  bzip2 -dk gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_3-2016q1tar.bz2
  ```
  and then add them to your PATH with
  ```
  # GCC
  PATH=~/bolos-devenv/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_3-2016q1/bin:$PATH
  # Clang
  PATH=~/bolos-devenv/clang+llvm-7.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/bin:$PATH
  ```

Next, to install the cross compilation headers required, use:

```
sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

Then install the Nano S SDK with

```
git clone git@github.com:LedgerHQ/nanos-secure-sdk.git
```

and add `export BOLOS_SDK=<PATH-TO-SDK>` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.

### Build and Load the Mina Ledger app

Running the following will install the Mina app on your Ledger device:

```
git clone git@github.com:MinaProtocol/ledger-mina-app.git
cd ledger-mina-app
git checkout 4574d3c
make load
```
