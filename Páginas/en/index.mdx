# Overview

Here's where you'll find all the documentation for the whole process of getting up and running with Mina.

## What is Mina?

Mina is the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain. Current cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum store hundreds of gigabytes of data, and as time goes on, their blockchains will only increase in size. With Mina however, no matter how much the usage grows, the blockchain always stays the same size - about 22kb <Footnote refNumber="[1]" link="/blog/22kb-sized-blockchain-a-technical-reference" /> (the size of a few tweets). This means participants can quickly sync and verify the netwo

This breakthrough is made possible due to zk-SNARKs - a type of succinct cryptographic proof. Each time a Mina node produces a new block, it also generates a SNARK proof verifying that the block was valid. All nodes can then store the small proof, as opposed to the entire chain. By not having to worry about block size, the Mina protocol enables a blockchain that is decentralized at scale.

## How does Mina work?

How does a ‘succinct blockchain’ work? Read our [technical white paper](https://minaprotocol.com/static/pdf/technicalWhitepaper.pdf) to learn more about our cryptographic preliminaries and the succinct blockchain construction used in Mina.

Check out our [economics white paper](https://minaprotocol.com/static/pdf/economicsWhitepaper.pdf) to learn about the roles within Mina Protocol, the incentive design and the monetary policy.
